Gratuitous Rap Battles
===================

A voice-recognition game where you have to name cheeses in rapid succession, among other things. Inspired by the youtube video series "Epic Rap Battles" and the video game "Gratuitous Space Battles", the original idea was to have your raps create space-ships which would the fight your opponents. It uses Google's Speech to text API.
